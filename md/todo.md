## Here I document the problems that faced me in the design and I couldn't solve it 

1.  center the logo ideally on mobile screens 
2. How to make the cart disappear without the need to use overflow: hidden on the body . Using overflow: hidden is problematic since that we can't scroll if the website has another content beyond the viewport (which is what is normally expected ) . 
3. In the swiper, on initial render, the first bullet doesn't have the transition and gets the blue color abruptly .
